A **p5.js**-powered local/online multiplayer chess app made without the help of any chess libraries.

This was my end-of-highschool project.

It has a good few issues, but I think it's alright for a high-school graduate.

The app is hosted on Heroku. It can be played [here](http://insanechess.herokuapp.com).
